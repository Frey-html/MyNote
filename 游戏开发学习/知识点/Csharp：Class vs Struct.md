In C#, classes and structs are both used to define types, but they have key differences:

#### 1. **Type Category**:
- **Class**: Reference type. Instances are stored on the heap, and variables hold references to the data.
- **Struct**: Value type. Instances are stored on the stack (or inline in other objects), and variables hold the actual data.

#### 2. **Memory Allocation**:
- **Class**: Memory is allocated on the heap, and garbage collection is used for cleanup.
- **Struct**: Memory is allocated on the stack, leading to quicker allocation and deallocation.

#### 3. **Inheritance**:
- **Class**: Supports inheritance, allowing for derived classes.
- **Struct**: Does not support inheritance (except from interfaces).

#### 4. **Default Constructor**:
- **Class**: Can define a parameterless constructor.
- **Struct**: Cannot define a parameterless constructor; a default constructor is automatically provided.

#### 5. **Nullability**:
- **Class**: Can be null.
- **Struct**: Cannot be null unless declared as a nullable type (e.g., `Nullable<T>` or `T?`).

#### 6. **Use Cases**:
- **Class**: Suitable for complex types with identity and behaviors (e.g., objects with methods).
- **Struct**: Ideal for small, lightweight types that represent a single value or are logically grouped (e.g., `Point`, `Color`).

These differences affect how you design and use data structures in your C# applications.

In C++, classes and structs are similar but have some important differences. Here’s a comparison:


### In C++
#### 1. **Default Access Modifier**:
- **Class**: The default access modifier is **private**. Members are private unless specified otherwise.
- **Struct**: The default access modifier is **public**. Members are public unless specified otherwise.

#### 2. **Inheritance**:
- **Class**: Inheritance is private by default unless specified as public or protected.
- **Struct**: Inheritance is public by default unless specified otherwise.

#### 3. **Usage Semantics**:
- **Class**: Generally used for more complex data types that encapsulate data and behavior (methods).
- **Struct**: Typically used for simple data structures that group related variables.

#### 4. **Member Functions**:
Both classes and structs can have member functions, constructors, destructors, and operators. There’s no functional difference in how these are defined or used.

#### 5. **Memory Allocation**:
Both can be allocated on the stack or heap, depending on how they are instantiated (e.g., using `new` for heap allocation).

#### 6. **Polymorphism**:
Both can use polymorphism through virtual functions, but the intent is usually clearer with classes.

#### Summary

In C++, the main differences lie in access control and default behaviors, but both constructs can be used interchangeably for many purposes. The choice between class and struct often comes down to style and intended use.
