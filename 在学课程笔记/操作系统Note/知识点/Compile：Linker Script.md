A **linker script** is a configuration file used by the linker (e.g., `ld` in GNU) to control the linking process of a program. It defines how the output executable or binary is structured, where different parts of the program (like code, data, and symbols) should be placed in memory, and how sections from the object files should be combined.

Linker scripts are commonly used in embedded systems or when building custom operating systems, where precise control over memory layout and placement of code and data is crucial.

### Key Functions of a Linker Script
1. **Memory Layout**: It defines the memory regions available for code, data, stack, etc., specifying where different sections of the program will reside in memory.
   
2. **Section Placement**: Controls how sections from object files (e.g., `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`) are mapped to memory. Sections contain different parts of a program like executable code, initialized data, or uninitialized data.

3. **Symbol Definition**: You can define custom symbols that point to specific addresses or memory locations, often used in embedded programming for things like startup code or interrupt vectors.

4. **Customizing Output**: Allows you to generate different types of output files, such as ELF files or raw binary files, and control the organization of these files.

### Common Uses of Linker Scripts
- **Embedded Systems**: Define memory regions for different parts of the program, since embedded systems often have limited and specific memory addresses (e.g., flash, RAM, stack).
  
- **Custom Operating Systems**: Define how to map kernel and user-space sections into different memory regions, control the boot process, and load drivers.

- **Controlling Section Layouts**: Place critical code or data in specific memory areas to improve performance, meet hardware constraints, or follow safety standards.

### Example Linker Script
Here is a simple example of a linker script that might be used in an embedded system:

```ld
MEMORY
{
    FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 256K
    RAM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
}

SECTIONS
{
    .text : 
    {
        *(.text)           /* All .text sections from object files */
        *(.rodata)         /* All .rodata sections */
    } > FLASH             /* Place .text in FLASH memory */

    .data : 
    {
        *(.data)           /* All .data sections from object files */
    } > RAM               /* Place .data in RAM */

    .bss : 
    {
        *(.bss)            /* All .bss sections (uninitialized data) */
    } > RAM               /* Place .bss in RAM */
}
```

### Sections of a Linker Script
- **MEMORY**: Defines memory regions (e.g., flash, RAM) and their size and permissions (`rx` for read-execute, `rwx` for read-write-execute).
  
- **SECTIONS**: Specifies how sections from object files (like `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`) are combined and where they are placed in memory.

### Key Terms
- **. Text**: Section containing program code (instructions).
- **. Data**: Section containing initialized data.
- **. Bss**: Section containing uninitialized data.
- **MEMORY**: Block that defines memory regions and sizes.
  
### Conclusion
A linker script gives you control over how your program is laid out in memory, which is critical in environments with constrained resources or special requirements, like embedded systems or low-level programming.
