### Right Quotient and Regular Languages

The **right quotient** (also called the **suffix closure**) of a language \( L \) by another language \( A \) is defined as:

$$
L / A = \{ w \mid \exists u \in A \text{ such that } wu \in L \}
$$

In the special case where \( A = \Sigma^* \) (i.e., the set of all possible strings over the alphabet \( \Sigma \)), the right quotient \( L / \Sigma^* \) is the set of all **suffixes** of strings in \( L \):

$$
L / \Sigma^* = \{ w \mid \exists u \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } uw \in L \}
$$

### Closure Under Right Quotient

Regular languages are closed under many operations, including **right quotient**. To show that the right quotient of a regular language is still regular, let's prove this using two methods: automata-based reasoning and regular expression-based reasoning.

### 1. Automata-based Proof (Using DFA/NFA)

Letâ€™s assume \( L \) is a regular language, which means there is a **deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** \( M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F) \) that recognizes \( L \), where:
- \( Q \) is the set of states,
- \( \Sigma \) is the input alphabet,
- \( \delta \) is the transition function \( \delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q \),
- \( q_0 \) is the start state,
- \( F \) is the set of accepting (final) states.

We are interested in constructing an automaton for the right quotient \( L / \Sigma^* \). That is, we want an automaton that accepts **all suffixes of strings in \( L \)**.

#### Key Insight

For a string \( w \) to be in \( L / \Sigma^* \), it means there exists some string \( u \in \Sigma^* \) such that \( uw \in L \). This tells us that if \( uw \in L \), then after reading \( w \), the automaton should be in a state that can reach a final state by reading some string \( u \).

#### Construction of a New NFA

We construct a new automaton \( M' = (Q, \Sigma, \delta', F', F') \) that recognizes the language \( L' = L / \Sigma^* \), where:
- The states \( Q \), input alphabet \( \Sigma \), and transition function \( \delta' \) are the same as in \( M \).
- The **start states** of \( M' \) are all the accepting states of \( M \), i.e., \( F' = F \). This ensures that the automaton can start anywhere from a point where a suffix might begin.
- The set of final states \( F' \) remains the same, i.e., \( F' = F \), because we are still looking for strings that eventually lead to an accepting state.

**Explanation**: The automaton \( M' \) accepts a string \( w \) if there is some state \( q_f \in F \) (a final state in \( M \)) such that after reading \( w \), the automaton can reach a state from which it can eventually accept a full string in \( L \).

This construction works because:
- The original DFA \( M \) processes \( uw \), and if it ends up in a final state after reading \( uw \), then starting from that state after reading \( u \), we can read the suffix \( w \) and accept it in \( M' \).

#### Conclusion from Automata

This new automaton \( M' \) recognizes the language \( L' = L / \Sigma^* \), which shows that the right quotient of a regular language by \( \Sigma^* \) is also regular.

### 2. Regular Expression-based Proof

If \( L \) is a regular language, there is a regular expression \( R \) that describes \( L \). We can construct a new regular expression to represent the right quotient \( L / A \).

In the case of \( A = \Sigma^* \) (the set of all strings), we are looking for the set of all suffixes of strings in \( L \).

#### Key Concept

For a regular language \( L \) described by a regular expression \( R \), every suffix of any string in \( L \) can still be generated by \( R \) itself, since regular languages are closed under operations like concatenation and Kleene star.

- **Example**: If \( R \) generates strings like \( ab \), then any suffix of \( ab \) (i.e., \( b \) or \( ab \)) can still be generated by parts of \( R \).

#### Constructing the Regular Expression for \( L / A \)

Since we're dealing with **suffixes**, the key is that the regular expression \( R \) itself can represent all suffixes of strings in \( L \), because:
- \( \Sigma^* \) allows for arbitrary prefixes (any \( u \)),
- The regular expression \( R \) already describes all valid strings in \( L \), so suffixes of those strings are already captured within the parts of \( R \).

Thus, the regular expression for \( L' \) (the right quotient) is the same as the regular expression for \( L \):

$$
R' = R
$$

This shows that the right quotient of a regular language is also regular.

### Conclusion

Regular languages are **closed under right quotient** because we can construct a new finite automaton or regular expression that accepts the right quotient of the language. This works because the regular language properties, such as closure under concatenation and star operations, ensure that suffixes of regular languages remain regular.
