After you compile the Linux kernel, several things happen and several components are generated. Understanding these components helps you grasp the role of the kernel and how it fits into the system. Letâ€™s break down the process and what each component means:

### What Happens After Compiling the Kernel

1. **Kernel Compilation**:
   - When you compile the kernel, you are building the core part of the Linux operating system. This includes the core functionalities necessary for managing hardware, system resources, and providing essential services for running applications.

2. **Generated Files**:
   - After compilation, several key files are generated. These include:

     - **`vmlinux`**: The uncompressed kernel image file.
     - **`bzImage`**: A compressed version of the kernel image that is used for booting. This is typically used in the boot process.
     - **`System.map`**: A symbol map file that provides a mapping of kernel symbols (functions and variables) to their addresses. This file is used for debugging and kernel-related tools.
     - **`config`**: The configuration file used for the kernel build, containing the settings and options enabled for the kernel.

### What the Kernel Contains

The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system, and it contains several critical elements:

1. **Kernel Code**:
   - The kernel code includes all the necessary code for managing hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network interfaces.

2. **Device Drivers**:
   - These are modules that allow the kernel to interact with hardware devices. Drivers for various devices (e.g., hard drives, network cards, USB devices) are included in the kernel or can be loaded as modules.

3. **System Calls**:
   - The kernel provides an interface for user-space applications to request services from the kernel, such as file operations, process management, and inter-process communication.

4. **Memory Management**:
   - The kernel handles memory allocation and management, including virtual memory, paging, and swapping.

5. **Process Management**:
   - The kernel manages process creation, scheduling, and termination. It handles multitasking and provides mechanisms for process synchronization.

6. **File Systems**:
   - The kernel includes support for various file systems, enabling it to read from and write to different types of storage devices.

7. **Networking**:
   - The kernel provides networking capabilities, including support for various network protocols and interfaces.

8. **Security and Permissions**:
   - The kernel enforces security policies and permissions, managing access control to resources and ensuring system security.

### `vmlinux`

- **Definition**: `vmlinux` is the uncompressed kernel image that contains the core Linux kernel code and data. It is typically used for debugging and development purposes, as it includes detailed debugging information and is not optimized for size.
  
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Uncompressed**: It is not compressed, so it is larger than the compressed boot image (`bzImage`).
  - **Debugging**: It may contain debugging symbols and other information useful for development and debugging.

### `bzImage`

- **Definition**: `bzImage` is a compressed version of the kernel image (`vmlinux`). It is the image that is typically used to boot the Linux system.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Compressed**: It is compressed to reduce its size and make it suitable for booting. The `bzImage` format is a commonly used compressed kernel image format.
  - **Boot Process**: The bootloader (such as GRUB) loads the `bzImage` into memory during the boot process.

### Summary

After compiling the kernel, you end up with several important files, including `vmlinux` (the uncompressed kernel image) and `bzImage` (the compressed kernel image used for booting). The kernel itself contains essential components like device drivers, system calls, memory management, process management, file systems, networking, and security mechanisms. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation of the operating system and its interactions with hardware and software.
