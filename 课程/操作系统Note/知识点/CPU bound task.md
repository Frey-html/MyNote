A **CPU-bound task** is a type of computation-heavy task that primarily depends on the processing power of the CPU. In other words, the task’s performance is limited by the speed and capability of the CPU, rather than by I/O operations (such as disk reads/writes or network communication).

### Characteristics of CPU-bound Tasks

1. **High Computational Load**: These tasks involve significant computation or data processing. Examples include mathematical calculations, data analysis, image processing, and complex simulations.

2. **CPU Utilization**: CPU-bound tasks consume a large amount of CPU resources. Their performance is directly related to the CPU's clock speed, number of cores, and architecture.

3. **Limited by CPU Speed**: The speed of these tasks is constrained by the CPU’s ability to perform computations. Adding more memory or optimizing I/O operations won’t significantly improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks.

4. **Concurrency Considerations**: In multi-threaded applications, CPU-bound tasks benefit from parallelism, where multiple threads or processes can run concurrently on different CPU cores. However, effective parallelism requires careful management to avoid issues like contention or excessive context switching.

### Examples of CPU-bound Tasks

1. **Mathematical Computations**:
   - Performing complex calculations, such as those used in scientific simulations or cryptographic algorithms.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Analyzing large datasets or performing data transformations that require intensive computation.

3. **Image and Video Processing**:
   - Tasks such as rendering, encoding, or decoding images and videos.

4. **Algorithm Execution**:
   - Running algorithms that involve heavy computations, like sorting large datasets or optimizing functions.

### Contrast with I/O-bound Tasks

**I/O-bound tasks**, in contrast, are limited by the speed of input/output operations rather than CPU performance. These tasks involve waiting for data to be read from or written to storage devices, networks, or other peripherals.

- **I/O-bound Task Example**: Reading a large file from disk or downloading data from the internet.

### Handling CPU-bound Tasks

1. **Multi-threading and Multi-processing**:
   - **Multi-threading**: Useful for tasks that can be parallelized across multiple cores. Threads can perform computations simultaneously, improving performance.
   - **Multi-processing**: Useful for tasks that require isolation or have a high degree of parallelism. Each process runs independently, allowing better utilization of multiple CPU cores.

2. **Optimization**:
   - **Algorithm Optimization**: Improving the efficiency of algorithms to reduce the amount of computation required.
   - **Code Optimization**: Writing efficient code to make better use of CPU resources.

3. **Hardware Upgrades**:
   - **More Cores**: Upgrading to a CPU with more cores can help handle more parallel computations.
   - **Higher Clock Speed**: A CPU with a higher clock speed can process tasks faster.

### Example in Python

Here’s an example of a CPU-bound task in Python that computes prime numbers:

```python
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def compute_primes(limit):
    primes = [n for n in range(limit) if is_prime(n)]
    return primes

if __name__ == '__main__':
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Using multiprocessing to handle the CPU-bound task
    with Pool() as pool:
        result = pool.apply_async(compute_primes, (100000,))
        primes = result.get()
    
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Computed {len(primes)} primes in {end_time - start_time} seconds.")
```

In this example, the `compute_primes` function is CPU-bound, and we use `multiprocessing.Pool` to parallelize the computation across multiple CPU cores, improving performance.

### Summary

- **CPU-bound tasks** are limited by the processing power of the CPU and involve intensive computations.
- **Handling CPU-bound tasks** effectively often involves multi-threading, multi-processing, or optimizing the computational algorithms and code.
- **Contrast with I/O-bound tasks**, which are limited by I/O operations and benefit from techniques that improve I/O performance.
