* `I1` depends on `I0` (register `f2`).
- `I2` is independent.
- `I3` depends on `I2` (register `f4`).
- `I4` depends on `I1` (register `f8`) and `I3` (register `f10`).
- `I5` depends on `I4` (register `f4`).
- `I6`, `I7`, and `I8` are independent.
- `I9` depends on `I8` (register `x20`).

**( 1 ) What is VLIW**
VLIW, which is abbreviation of Very Long Instruction Word,  is a computer architecture technique that allows multiple instructions to be issued and executed in parallel within a single clock cycle. It relies on the compiler to perform instruction scheduling and dependency analysis, rather than having complex hardware handle these tasks dynamically.
**( 2 ) How to solve RAW and WAR**
It relies on compiler to schedule the instruction so that no RAW and WAR hazard would happens in one instruction sequence.
**( 3 ) Adavantages and Disadvantages**
Adavantages: Reduce complexity of hardware design, The execution order is more predictable
Disadvantages: It highly depend on compiler, bigger Instruction size can leads to bigger binary size
