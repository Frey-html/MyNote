### Question3:
需要注意cache Blocksize和总线宽度，从下一级存储取到cache时，至少要取cache的块大小
- **Processor clock frequency**: 1.0 GHz = 1 ns per cycle.
- **CPI excluding memory accesses**: 1.35.
- **Instruction breakdown**:
  - Loads: 20%
  - Stores: 10%
- **L1 caches (I-cache & D-cache)**:
  - I-cache miss rate: 2%
  - D-cache miss rate: 5%
  - L1 caches (I-cache & D-cache) impose no penalty on hits.
- **Write buffer for D-cache eliminates stalls for 90% of writes**.
- **L2 cache**:
  - Size: 512 KB
  - Write-back, unified
  - Miss rate: 15% (since 85% of accesses are satisfied in L2 without going to main memory).
  - Access time: 12 ns.
  - L2-L1 bus bandwidth: 128 bits (16 bytes) per transfer at 266 MHz = $\frac{1}{266 \text{ MHz}} = 3.76 \text{ ns}$ per 16-byte block transfer.
- **Main memory**:
  - Access latency: 80 ns
  - Memory bus bandwidth: 128 bits (16 bytes) at 133 MHz = $\frac{1}{133 \text{ MHz}} = 7.52 \text{ ns}$ per transfer.

---

### **(a) Average Memory Access Time for Instruction Accesses**

For instruction accesses, we only need to consider the I-cache and L2 cache misses.

1. **L1 miss penalty for instruction accesses**:
   - If there's an I-cache miss, data is fetched from L2.
   - L2 access time = 12 ns.
   - L1 to L2 bus transfer time for one 32-byte block:
     - 32 bytes / 16 bytes per bus transfer = 2 bus transfers.
     - Total transfer time = $2 \times 3.76 \text{ ns} = 7.52 \text{ ns}$.
   - Therefore, the total **L1 miss penalty** = 12 ns (L2 access time) + 7.52 ns (bus transfer) = 19.52 ns.

2. **L2 miss penalty for instruction accesses**:
   - If there's an L2 miss, data must be fetched from main memory.
   - Main memory access latency = 80 ns.
   - Main memory bus transfer time for one 64-byte block:
     - 64 bytes / 16 bytes per transfer = 4 transfers.
     - Total transfer time = $4 \times 7.52 \text{ ns} = 30.08 \text{ ns}$.
   - Therefore, the total **L2 miss penalty** = 80 ns (main memory latency) + 30.08 ns (bus transfer) = 110.08 ns.

3. **AMAT for instruction accesses**:

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{I}} = \text{L1 hit time} + (\text{I-cache miss rate} \times (\text{L2 hit time} + \text{L2 miss rate} \times \text{main memory penalty}))
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{I}} = 1 \text{ ns} + (0.02 \times (19.52 \text{ ns} + 0.15 \times 110.08 \text{ ns}))
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{I}} = 1 \text{ ns} + (0.02 \times (19.52 \text{ ns} + 16.51 \text{ ns}))
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{I}} = 1 \text{ ns} + (0.02 \times 36.03 \text{ ns}) = 1 \text{ ns} + 0.72 \text{ ns}
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{I}} = 1.72 \text{ ns}
$$

### **(b) Average Memory Access Time for Data Reads**

For data reads, we consider the D-cache and L2 cache misses.

1. **L1 miss penalty for data reads**:
   - Data cache miss penalty is similar to instruction access.
   - L1 miss penalty for a D-cache miss = 19.52 ns (same as in part a).

2. **L2 miss penalty for data reads**:
   - L2 miss penalty is also the same as for instruction accesses = 110.08 ns.

3. **AMAT for data reads**:

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-read}} = \text{L1 hit time} + (\text{D-cache miss rate} \times (\text{L2 hit time} + \text{L2 miss rate} \times \text{main memory penalty}))
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-read}} = 1 \text{ ns} + (0.05 \times (19.52 \text{ ns} + 0.15 \times 110.08 \text{ ns}))
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-read}} = 1 \text{ ns} + (0.05 \times (19.52 \text{ ns} + 16.51 \text{ ns}))
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-read}} = 1 \text{ ns} + (0.05 \times 36.03 \text{ ns}) = 1 \text{ ns} + 1.80 \text{ ns}
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-read}} = 2.80 \text{ ns}
$$

---

### **(c) Average Memory Access Time for Data Writes**

For data writes, we must account for the D-cache's **write-through** policy and the **write buffer**.

1. **90% of writes are handled by the write buffer**, so they impose **no penalty**.

2. **10% of writes** (the ones not handled by the write buffer) require access to the **L2 cache**.
   - L2 access time = 12 ns.
   - L2 miss penalty (when a dirty block is written back) = 110.08 ns (same as reads).

3. **AMAT for data writes**:

The write buffer eliminates stalls for 90% of writes, so we only care about the 10% that miss in the write buffer. For those, the D-cache miss rate will determine if they access L2 or main memory.

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-write}} = \text{L1 hit time} + 0.10 \times (\text{D-cache miss rate} \times (\text{L2 hit time} + \text{L2 miss rate} \times \text{main memory penalty}))
$$

Substituting values:

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-write}} = 1 \text{ ns} + 0.10 \times (0.05 \times (19.52 \text{ ns} + 0.15 \times 110.08 \text{ ns}))
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-write}} = 1 \text{ ns} + 0.10 \times (0.05 \times (19.52 \text{ ns} + 16.51 \text{ ns}))
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-write}} = 1 \text{ ns} + 0.10 \times (0.05 \times 36.03 \text{ ns})
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-write}} = 1 \text{ ns} + 0.10 \times 1.80 \text{ ns} = 1 \text{ ns} + 0.18 \text{ ns}
$$

$$
\text{AMAT}_{\text{D-write}} = 1.18 \text{ ns}
$$

### **(d) Overall CPI Including Memory Accesses**

Now, we calculate the overall CPI by accounting for instruction fetches, data reads, and data writes. The given instruction mix is:
- **Loads (data reads)**: 20%
- **Stores (data writes)**: 10%

The total CPI formula is:

$$
\text{CPI} = \text{Base CPI} + (\text{Instruction frequency} \times \text{AMAT}_{\text{I}}) + (\text{Load frequency} \times \text{AMAT}_{\text{D-read}}) + (\text{Store frequency} \times \text{AMAT}_{\text{D-write}})
$$


### Question4
### **Understanding the Problem:**

We are dealing with matrix transpose operations on a cache-sensitive system. The given problem discusses a simple 256 × 256 single-precision matrix transpose, a fully associative 16 KB L1 data cache with an 8-byte block size, and describes the need to use blocking (or tiling) optimization to improve performance. The questions ask about optimizing this matrix transpose to reduce cache misses and analyzing the relative performance of blocked vs. unblocked approaches.

---

### **Question (a): Minimum Size of Cache for Blocked Execution**

To determine the **minimum size of the cache** required to fully utilize blocking in the matrix transpose operation, we need to compute how much data must fit into the cache at any one time for blocked execution to be effective.

For a blocked matrix transpose:
- The matrix is broken into smaller submatrices (blocks).
- We process blocks, ensuring that a block fits into the cache.

The matrix is 256 × 256, and each element is a **single-precision floating point** (4 bytes).

Let’s assume a block size of \( B \times B \), where both input and output blocks need to fit into the cache simultaneously for optimal performance.

The size of each block in the cache is:
- For the input block: \( B \times B \times 4 \) bytes.
- For the output block: \( B \times B \times 4 \) bytes.

Thus, the total size of the data that must fit in the cache for blocked execution is:
\[
2 \times (B \times B \times 4) \, \text{bytes} = 8B^2 \, \text{bytes}
\]

Now, for blocked execution to be effective, **this data must fit into the L1 cache**. Given that the cache size is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), we have the condition:
\[
8B^2 \leq 16,384
\]
\[
B^2 \leq \frac{16,384}{8} = 2,048
\]
\[
B \leq \sqrt{2,048} \approx 45.25
\]

Therefore, the block size \( B \) must be **45 or smaller** for the blocks to fit into the cache. A commonly used block size for cache-blocking is 32 because it's a power of two and matches common cache line sizes.

Thus, **the minimum block size \( B \) that the cache must support is 32**.

---

### **Question (b): Relative Number of Misses in Blocked vs. Unblocked Versions**

1. **Unblocked Transpose:**
   - In the unblocked version of the transpose, the row-major order access pattern for the **input matrix** is fine (it matches the natural memory layout). However, accessing the **output matrix** in column-major order results in non-sequential access.
   - Each access to the output matrix causes cache misses because of this non-sequential access, as the data for each column is not contiguous in memory. This leads to **more cache misses**.

2. **Blocked Transpose:**
   - In the blocked version, both the **input** and **output** matrices are accessed in smaller blocks, which fit into the cache.
   - This results in fewer cache misses because once a block is loaded into the cache, **all accesses within that block are cache hits**, both for the input and output matrices. The access is localized, and cache lines are reused efficiently.

**Conclusion:**
- The blocked version will have **fewer cache misses** compared to the unblocked version, especially for the output matrix, due to the better utilization of the cache when blocks fit entirely in the cache.

---

### **Question (c): Blocked Transpose Code**

Here is a C-style code implementation of the matrix transpose using blocking. The `block_size` parameter allows you to tune the size of the blocks used in the transpose:

```c
void transpose_blocked(float input[256][256], float output[256][256], int block_size) {
    int i, j, ii, jj;
    
    for (ii = 0; ii < 256; ii += block_size) {
        for (jj = 0; jj < 256; jj += block_size) {
            // Transpose the block
            for (i = ii; i < ii + block_size && i < 256; i++) {
                for (j = jj; j < jj + block_size && j < 256; j++) {
                    output[j][i] = input[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this code:
- The outer loops (`ii` and `jj`) iterate over the matrix in block-sized chunks.
- The inner loops (`i` and `j`) handle the actual transpose within each block.
- The `block_size` controls the size of the blocks, and both the input and output matrices are accessed within blocks to improve cache utilization.

---

### **Question (d): Minimum Associativity for Consistent Performance**

The question asks about the **minimum cache associativity** required to ensure **consistent performance** regardless of the memory alignment of the arrays.

1. **Direct-Mapped Cache Issues**:
   - With a **direct-mapped cache**, if two different memory addresses map to the same cache line (i.e., have the same cache index), it causes **conflicts**. This can lead to cache thrashing, where frequently accessed data evicts other data, leading to more cache misses.

2. **Set-Associative Caches**:
   - With a **set-associative cache**, each cache index can store multiple cache lines (depending on the associativity). This reduces the chance of conflicts because more than one block can map to the same set.
   - **Fully associative caches** have no conflict issues, but are expensive to implement.

To avoid conflicts and ensure **consistent performance** regardless of the alignment of the input and output matrices, a minimum associativity of **2-way** or **4-way** set-associative cache is generally sufficient. Higher associativity further reduces the chance of conflicts, but 2-way or 4-way associativity is often enough for this type of workload.

---

### **Summary of Answers:**

- **(a)** The minimum block size \( B \) should be **32** for blocked execution to fit in the cache.
- **(b)** The blocked version will have **significantly fewer cache misses** compared to the unblocked version.
- **(c)** The blocked transpose code is provided above.
- **(d)** A **2-way or 4-way set-associative cache** is the minimum associativity required for consistent performance independent of array positions in memory.
