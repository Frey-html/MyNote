The command `nm vmlinux` is used to display the **symbol table** of the `vmlinux` file (or any ELF executable). The symbol table includes the names, addresses, and types of functions, variables, and other symbols in the executable.

In the context of the Linux kernel, `vmlinux` is the uncompressed, non-bootable kernel image, and using the `nm` command on it allows you to inspect the symbols within the kernel image.

### What the `nm` Command Does
- **`nm`** lists the symbols from object files, libraries, or executables.
- It shows **symbol names**, their **memory addresses**, and the **symbol type** (whether it’s a function, variable, or something else).

### Output Format of `nm`

The output of `nm vmlinux` typically looks like this:

```
address    type    symbol_name
```

For example:

```
0000000000004000 T _start
0000000000004010 T main
0000000000004030 D global_var
0000000000004050 B uninitialized_var
```

Each line represents a symbol, with the following details:

1. **Address**: The memory address where the symbol is located in the file or executable.
2. **Type**: A one-letter code that indicates the type of symbol.
3. **Symbol Name**: The name of the symbol (functions, variables, etc.).

### Common Symbol Types (Codes)

- **`T`**: The symbol is in the **text section** (typically, executable code or functions).
- **`D`**: The symbol is in the **initialized data section** (global or static variables that are initialized).
- **`B`**: The symbol is in the **BSS section** (uninitialized data or variables that will be initialized to zero).
- **`R`**: The symbol is in a **read-only section** (often constants or read-only variables).
- **`U`**: The symbol is **undefined** (it is expected to be resolved by a library or another object file).
- **`N`**: The symbol is a **debugging symbol**.
- **`W`**: The symbol is a **weak symbol**, meaning it can be overridden by other definitions.
- **`V`**: The symbol is **weak and undefined**.
- **`A`**: The symbol is an **absolute symbol** (not tied to a specific section).

### Example Output Explanation

Let’s take this example output:

```
0000000000400000 T _start
0000000000400010 T kernel_main
0000000000600050 D global_data
0000000000600070 B uninit_var
```

- **`_start`** and **`kernel_main`** are located in the text section (code) and start at addresses `0x400000` and `0x400010` respectively.
- **`global_data`** is an initialized data variable, starting at address `0x600050` in the data section.
- **`uninit_var`** is an uninitialized variable, located in the BSS section starting at address `0x600070`.

### Usage in Kernel Development

When dealing with the Linux kernel (such as using `nm` on the `vmlinux` file), this information is useful for:

- **Debugging**: Viewing where functions or variables are located in memory.
- **Performance Tuning**: Identifying where critical kernel components reside.
- **Customization**: Exploring symbol information when modifying or adding to the kernel.

### Example Command and Output

Run the command:

```bash
nm vmlinux | less
```

This will list the symbols in `vmlinux` and allow you to scroll through the output.

Alternatively, you can filter specific symbols:

```bash
nm vmlinux | grep "main"
```

This will show any symbols related to `main`, which could help identify the kernel's main entry point.

### Summary
The `nm vmlinux` command shows the symbol table for the `vmlinux` kernel image. The output lists all functions and variables, their addresses, and their types, which is essential for debugging, inspecting, and understanding the internals of the Linux kernel.
