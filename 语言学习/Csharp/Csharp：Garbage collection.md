Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management that helps reclaim memory allocated to objects that are no longer in use. Here’s a detailed overview of how it works and how to minimize its impact on performance:

### How Garbage Collection Works

- **Generations**:
    - C# divides objects into three generations:
	    [[Csharp：Divide in GC]]
        - **Generation 0**: Short-lived objects (new allocations).
        - **Generation 1**: Objects that survived one collection.
        - **Generation 2**: Long-lived objects (e.g., application-level caches).
    
- **Mark Phase**:
    - The GC starts from [[Csharp：Root Reference]]， such as static fields, local variables, and active threads.
    - It traverses through all reachable objects, marking them as live.
    - This is done using a technique called **tracing**, where the GC follows references from roots to reach all connected objects.
    
- **Sweep Phase**:
    - After marking, the GC scans through the heap to identify unmarked objects.
    - Unmarked objects are considered unreachable and are collected. Their memory is reclaimed for future allocations.
    
- **Compaction** (Optional):
    - Although the base implementation may not always compact, the GC can move live objects closer together to eliminate fragmentation.
    - This improves allocation speed by making contiguous blocks of memory available.
    
- **Finalization**: If an object has a finalizer (a `Finalize` method), it is placed in a finalization queue instead of being collected immediately. The GC will call the finalizer before the object is reclaimed, allowing for cleanup operations.
    
- **Promotion**: When objects survive collections in Generation 0, they are promoted to Generation 1, and similarly for Generation 1 to Generation 2. This promotes the longevity of objects, minimizing overhead for frequently collected generations.
    
- **Allocation Pressure**: Frequent allocations in Generation 0 lead to more frequent collections. The GC triggers a collection when it determines that memory usage exceeds a certain threshold.

### How to Minimize Garbage Collection Impact

1. **Object Pooling**:
   - Reuse objects instead of creating new ones. This minimizes allocations, reducing the frequency of GC cycles.

2. **Minimize Allocations**:
   - Avoid unnecessary object allocations, especially in performance-critical sections (e.g., inside loops).
   - Use primitive types or structures when possible.

3. **Immutable Data Structures**:
   - Be cautious with immutable types, as creating a new instance for every modification can lead to excessive allocations.

4. **Avoid Large Objects**:
   - Large object allocations can trigger a full GC cycle. Try to break large objects into smaller ones or manage them manually.

5. **Explicit Resource Management**:
   - For resources like file handles, database connections, or network sockets, use `using` statements or explicit `Dispose()` methods to release resources promptly.

6. **Profiling and Monitoring**:
   - Use profiling tools to monitor allocation rates and GC pauses. This helps identify hotspots where memory allocation is high.

7. **Adjusting GC Settings**:
   - In environments like .NET or Java, you can adjust GC settings (e.g., switching between different GC algorithms) to optimize performance based on your application’s needs.

8. **Using Value Types**:
   - In languages like C#, consider using value types (structs) for small data structures to avoid heap allocations.

### Summary

By understanding how garbage collection works and applying strategies to reduce unnecessary allocations, you can significantly improve the performance of your applications. Regular profiling and tuning based on the specific behavior of your application will help maintain optimal performance.
